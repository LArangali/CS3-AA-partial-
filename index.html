				Karasuno High School (烏野高校, Karasuno Kōkō) is located in Miyagi Prefecture, Tōhoku region. The karasu part of the school name means 'crow'. 
				The Karasuno volleyball team is nicknamed "Flightless Crows" and "Fallen Champs" since they were a powerhouse team that had fallen from grace; 
				they are also called "Country Bumpkin Crows" by rival Nekoma captain Kuroo since they live in a rural area. 
				According to Oikawa, Karasuno doesn't have a particular play style and instead opts to experiment with new styles. 
				Karasuno has a long-standing rivalry with Nekoma High School, located in Tokyo, which is dubbed the "Battle at the Trash Heap" because crows and cats (Nekoma's mascot) are known to rummage through garbage. 
				Within its own prefecture, its main rivals are Aoba Johsai High School, Date Tech High School, and Shiratorizawa Academy. 
				Karasuno's banner is all black with the sole word "fly" in white. Its team colors are black and orange.
